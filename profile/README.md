# Munich Embedded

**The** place for Munich's embedded community.

We started with the first Munich Embedded conference in October 2025 in Munich and will have our next conference on 27th October 2026.
In the meantime, this GitHub organization should serve as a place to collect ideas and organize other community meetups until the next conference.
