# Munich Embedded

**The** place for Munich's embedded community.

We started with the first Munich Embedded conference on 28 October 2025 in Munich and plan to have another conference in 2026.
In the meantime, this GitHub organization should serve as a place to collect ideas and organize other community meetups until the next conference.
